# bootcamp-1.1
This game is a simple racing game that the player watches while trying to activate a button to win. The player must click a button on time in order for the car to move faster, if the player misses the car will continue at normal pace. Currently no functionality has been added for both the npc cars and the player car.

I attempted to use asynchrony for the npc cars. I used eventlisteners for the buttons however it is still not complete.
